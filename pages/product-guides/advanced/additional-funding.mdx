# Accepting Additional Funding

Bounties can be set to accept additional funding in the original token of the bounty (this is an option during the in the [create screen](/product-guides/#creating-a-bounty)). If enabled, users will see a "Fund this Bounty" button on the page, which will allow them to add funds to the bounty pot. Note that all control of the bounty approval still lies with the issuer and approvers.
