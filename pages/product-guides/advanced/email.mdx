# Email Notifications

Email notifications are sent (optionally) for specific events in the workflow of a bounty when using Aikido.

Notifications sent to bounty issuers:
- When a contributor claims an active bounty
- When a contributor applies to an active bounty

Notifications sent to bounty contributors:
- When an issuer accepts a bounty application
- When an issuer accepts bounty claim(s), and any payment is released

Email notifications to issuers are optional - i.e. they are only sent if they choose to add an email to their workspace. For contributors, making a claim currently requires an email.
