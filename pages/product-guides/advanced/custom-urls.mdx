# Custom URLs

When you set up a workspace on Aikido, the default URL is either your Ethereum address, or your ENS (if one exists for that address). Now, you can also create a custom URL for your project workspace, making it easier to share with your community and preserving privacy of your wallet address. A custom URL might look something like `aikido.work/board/ethereum`. 

To claim a custom URL, simply go to your Board Settings > Custom URL.

A few notes:
* Custom URLs are backwards compatible - so even if a custom URL exists, the URL with the wallet address (`aikido.work/board/0x12345`) or ENS (`aikido.work/board/bob.eth`) will still resolve to the board, preserving any existing links.
* For now, aikido.work and polygon.aikido.work are different workspaces and therefore have their own custom URLs. So, if `bob.eth` creates a workspace on www.aikido.work AND polygon.aikido.work, their custom URLs can both co-exist. So,

`polygon.aikido.work/board/bobsproject --> polygon.aikido.work/board/bob.eth`
`aikido.work/board/bobsproject --> aikido.work/board/bob.eth`
