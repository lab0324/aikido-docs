# Applications

If you set a bounty to require applications, users will have to apply before submitting a claim to the bounty. You can optionally also add a date to select when applications need to be submitted. 

Once an application is accepted, then only those addresses will be able to submit a claim to the bounty. 

Applications and submissions are not allowed for bounties in draft mode.
