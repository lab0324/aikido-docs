## Creating a Bounty

Creating a bounty is a simple form with the following required fields:
- Title (keep this short and easy to understand)
- Description (a clear description of deliverables and a "definition of done")
- Reward: in ETH or any ERC20 token. 
- Deadline: The date the bounty will close (i.e no new submissions allowed)

Additionally, you have the option to:
- Accept Applications: Specify whether your bounty requires a pre-application (useful for bigger tasks and grant programs)
- Accept Additional Funding: Specify whether anyone can add additional funds to a bounty (e.g. to sponsor or support the work)

## Accepting submissions

Once your bounty is created, share the bounty page with your community to accept submissions. Submitters have two options:
- Claim a bounty directly, with a submission as a proof of work.
- Apply for a Bounty with details about them. This is optional, and only happens if an issuer selects "Require Application" when creating a bounty. 

Submissions and claims happen "off-chain", which means submitters do not have to pay any gas fees for working on your bounty. 

## Rewarding Contributors

To accept a contribution, press "Accept" next to the Submission and a dialog will appear allowing you to specify the amount to reward. You can choose to reward the entire bounty, or a partial amount (for example, for a milestone payment or if you want to reward multiple users).
