# Aikido Bounty Wizard (Bounty.new)

To make it really easy to create on-chain bounties, we've created a bounty creation wixard at [https://bounty.new/](https://bounty.new/).

At any point during this wizard, you can save an (off-chain) DRAFT while you finalize details, and then Mint it on-chain once its ready. 

## Step 1: Describe your Bounty

## Step 2: Deadlines and Rewards

Set deadlines, reward amounts, and application details for your bounty. Here, you can also specify whether you want your bounty to accept additional funds.

## Step 3: Mint your Bounty on Chain

Once you've specified bounty details, you can go ahead and press "Mint Bounty" to create the Bounty.

After this stage, you will be taken to the individual bounty page with URL `aikido.work/bounty/[BOUNTY-ID]`. You can share this page with your community to start accepting submissions.
