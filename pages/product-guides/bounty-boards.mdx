# Bounty Boards

If you're managing a lot of bounties with your community, you can manage them using Aikido's bounty board tool. This guide will help you get started using a bounty board on Aikido.

## Connecting Your wallet

Like most Web3 Dapps, Aikido Boards uses your Ethereum wallet as your primary identifier. If you want to use a Multisig wallet, try out our [Gnosis Safe App](/product-guides/gnosis-safe-app). 

Aikido has been deployed to a variety of other EVM compatible chains, so if you want to set up bounties on those chains, use one of the following:

- [Goerli Testnet](https://goerli.aikido.work)
- [Polygon](https://polygon.aikido.work)
- [Mumbai Testnet]()
- [Rinkeby Testnet](https://rinkeby.aikido.work) (Will be deprecated post-ETH merge)

## Setting up your Board

Start by setting some metadata for your board. You can change this information later by going to [https://www.aikido.work/dashboard/settings](https://www.aikido.work/dashboard/settings). You will also be able to customize other board settings, like a Twitter or Discord link for your community. If there is other metadata you would like to see,

## Managing Your Board

All bounties that are created with your wallet appear on your bounty board. **Bounties created on [bounty.new](https://bounty.new) with the same wallet will appear here too.** You have the option of hiding draft bounties from the board in your board settings.

## Creating a New Bounty

When you click "Create a Bounty", you will see a form to create a new on-chain bounty. Note that this is a little different than the bounty.new wizard, but you can do all the same things.
