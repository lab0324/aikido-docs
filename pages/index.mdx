# Aikido

**Aikido** is a tool to help anyone list work on-chain using the Ethereum blockchain. Being on-chain has many advantages:
- Work can be listed and completed through different marketplaces and tools
- Rewards can be held in smart contracts that are released as soon as work is completed
- An on-chain record of work is the foundation of an immutable, soveriegn reputation

In addition, on-chain work listings enable new use cases not possible today, like the ability for multiple parties to fund a task work towards a community good. 

Aikido has been inspired by and is building upon the work done by the StandardBounties protocol.

These docs will cover two things:
- An overview of the **Aikido protocol**
- A series of **product guides** for tools we've built on the protocol.

Please note these docs are a very active work in progress, and if you have any immediate questions about the product or protocol, [hop into the Discord](https://discord.gg/JKjY5tmvSu) or DM us on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/withaikido).
