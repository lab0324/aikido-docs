# Aikido

**Aikido** is a protocol and set of tools to power the contributor economy. Aikido enables anyone to list work on-chain with attached rewards on the Ethereum blockchain (also, on some EVM compatible chains). We has been inspired by and are building upon the work done by the StandardBounties protocol.

There are many advantages to putting requests for work on-chain:
- Tasks can be listed and completed through different marketplaces and tools
- Rewards can be held in smart contracts that are released as soon as work is completed
- We can build a detailed and immutable record of work on-chain

In addition, on-chain work listings enable new use cases not possible today, like the ability for multiple parties to fund a task work towards a community good.

These docs will cover the following:
- [Protocol Overview](/protocol): How the protocol functions and developer guides
- [Product Guides](/product-guides): User guides for the tools we've built on the protocol

Please note these docs are a very active work in progress, and if you have any immediate questions, [hop into the Discord](https://discord.gg/JKjY5tmvSu) or DM us on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/withaikido).
